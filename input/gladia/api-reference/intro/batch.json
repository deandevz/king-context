You can sign-up through Google and more sign-up methods will be available in the near future.\n\n## Get your API key\n\nNow that you signed up, login to app.gladia.io and go to the [API keys section](https://app.gladia.io/apikeys). We should have already created a default key for you. You can use this one or create your own.\n\n> Gladia offers 10 Hours of free audio transcription per month if you want to test the service!\n\nWith your API key, you're now ready to use Gladia APIs.\n\n## Authenticate your API calls\n\nOnce you got your API key, pass it in the header `x-gladia-key`, like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET \\\n  --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \\\n  --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY'\n```\n\nThe header authentication method ensures that you are able to use Gladia in any environment or any cloud-based third party service.\n\nThis is the **only** authentication method you'll need to use all the API endpoints.\n\nNext, we'll see what's the general pre-recorded flow and how to manage it on your side."
