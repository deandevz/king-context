This dictionary should contain the correct spelling as the key and a list of one or more possible variations as the value. Custom spelling is useful in scenarios where consistent spelling of specific words is crucial (e.g., technical terms in industry-specific recordings).\n\nThe keys in the dictionary are case sensitive, while the values aren't. Values can contain multiple words.\n\n## Request Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"custom_spelling\": true,\n  \"custom_spelling_config\": {\n    \"spelling_dictionary\": {\n      \"Gorish\": [\"ghorish\", \"gaurish\", \"gaureish\"],\n      \"Data Science\": [\"data-science\", \"data science\"],\n      \".\": [\"period\", \"full stop\"],\n      \"SQL\": [\"sequel\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the model will ensure that \"Gorish\" is spelled correctly throughout the transcript, even if it is pronounced in various ways such as \"ghorish,\" \"gaurish,\" or \"gaureish.\""
