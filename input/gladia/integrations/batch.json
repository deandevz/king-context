Instead of worrying about telecom infrastructure, you can focus on your product. In this guide, we'll use Twilio for voice with Gladia Speech-to-Text.\n\n## Twilio Media Streams\n\nTwilio Programmable Voice lets you make and receive calls. Media Streams can send real-time audio from a live call to your server over WebSocket. When connected to Gladia's low-latency Speech-to-Text (STT), you get instant transcription. This powers real-time voice agents, call analytics, compliance tools, and live captions.\n\nWant the full API reference? Check the official Twilio Media Streams docs: [www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream).\n\n## What you can build\n\n- Real-time transcription and analytics\n- IVR and call center bots\n- Compliance and QA monitoring\n- Live captions on phone calls\n\n## Quickstart\n\nTry our sample project that connects Twilio Media Streams with Gladia STT:\n\n[gladia-samples/integrations-examples/twilio](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia-samples/tree/main/integrations-examples/twilio)\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Get your API key](https://app.gladia.io/apikeys) - Get your API key on the Gladia dashboard\n- [Twilio with Gladia](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia-samples/tree/main/integrations-examples/twilio) - See and run the complete sample\n- [Twilio Media Streams docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream) - Learn about streaming audio from Twilio"
